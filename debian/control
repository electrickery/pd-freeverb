Description: studio-quality Schroeder/Moorer reverb as a Pd object
 Freeverb is a simple implementation of the standard Schroeder/Moorer
 reverb model. It uses 8 comb filters on both the left and right
 channels. Note that this version of Freeverb doesn't contain
 predelay, or any EQ.  It is implemented as a Pd object, so it can
 easily be inserted into a Pd patch.
